## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

**Introduction**
<P>This repo contains the files required (except data) for Getting and Cleaning 
Data Course Project. </P>

**Setup**  
The data files required to run the source code can be downloaded from this <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip">link</a>. The source code and downloaded data file should be unzipped into this folder on your   computer i.e. C:/Coursera/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/Project. Create the directory and folders if it does not exist yet.Rename the unzipped data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" to "data" before 
running the source code "run_analysis.R"

**About run_analysis.R**  
The R script run_analysis.R does the following:  
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject<BR>   
   
The data created from Step 5 is at this <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera-uploads/user-e8f9861397ebef4141779706/972585/asst-3/17482b103e3211e4b10c030fe14d2736.txt">link</a>.
